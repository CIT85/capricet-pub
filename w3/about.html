   <h1>Why am I Taking this Course?</h1> 
   <p>I am taking this course because it is a required course for the degree I want to finish in Web Development. I have taken this course before but I am redoing it because I tend to get distracted with other things and the pressure of everyday life and give up on taking the class. I want so desperately to change that this semester, so that is why I am here again. </p>

   <h2>Chat GPT</h2>
   <p>Using Chat GPT for this assignment was fun. It did a great deal of the content for me, while I finish the  HTML on the page. I like thinking of Chat GPT as a tool because it delivered the info I needed extremely fast and all I had to do was tell it what to do.</p>
